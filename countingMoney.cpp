briefing : Input: You start with a total amount of money you want to count.

Define Denominations: You need to know the different denominations of bills and coins that make up the currency you're dealing with. For example, in the US, common denominations are $100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1 bills, and quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢).

Algorithm:

Start with the highest denomination.
Divide the total amount by the value of the denomination.
The whole number part tells you how many of that denomination you need.
Subtract the value of those bills/coins from the total amount.
Move to the next lower denomination and repeat until you've accounted for all denominations.
Output: Once you've gone through all denominations, you'll have a count of each type of bill or coin needed to represent the total amount.

Example:
Let's say you want to count $123.47.

Start with the highest denomination, $100:
$123.47 / $100 = 1, so you need 1 $100 bill.
Subtract $100 from $123.47, leaving $23.47.
Move to the next denomination, $50:
$23.47 / $50 = 0, as you don't need any $50 bills.
Continue with $20, $10, $5, $1 bills, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies using the same process until you've accounted for all the money.
End: Once you've gone through all denominations, you'll have a count of each type of bill or coin needed to represent the total amount.

Output: For our example, the output might be:

1 $100 bill
0 $50 bills
1 $20 bill
0 $10 bills
0 $5 bills
3 $1 bills
1 quarter
2 dimes
0 nickels
2 pennies
That's it! The algorithm helps you count money efficiently by breaking down the total amount into the fewest number of bills and coins neede
